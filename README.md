JavaScript Functionality (script.js)
The JavaScript file provides the following functionality:

Password strength calculation and indicator update
Form submission handling (currently simulated)
Setup and Customization
Replace 'YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY' in the HTML file with your actual Google reCAPTCHA site key.
Customize the background image by replacing the URL in the .left-side class in the CSS file.
Adjust colors, fonts, and other styles in the CSS file to match your brand.
Implement actual form submission logic in the JavaScript file.
Responsive Behavior
The page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:

On larger screens, it displays a side-by-side layout.
On smaller screens (max-width: 768px), it switches to a vertical layout with the content stacked.
Accessibility Considerations
Proper use of semantic HTML elements
Labels associated with form inputs
Color contrast ratios for readability
Keyboard navigation support
Performance Optimization
External resources (fonts, reCAPTCHA) are loaded asynchronously
CSS is minified (can be further optimized)
Images should be optimized for web use
Security Considerations
Implementation of reCAPTCHA to prevent bot submissions
Client-side form validation (should be complemented with server-side validation)
Secure submission of form data (HTTPS recommended)
Future Enhancements
Implement actual form submission to a backend server
Add email verification process
Enhance password strength requirements
Implement social media authentication
Add form validation error messages
Create a multi-step form process for improved mobile experience
Browser Compatibility
The page is designed to work on modern browsers including:

Chrome (latest)
Firefox (latest)
Safari (latest)
Edge (latest)
Known Issues
The password strength indicator is a basic implementation and should be enhanced for production use.
Social media sign-up buttons are currently non-functional placeholders.
